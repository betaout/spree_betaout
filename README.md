SpreeBetaout
============

This gem integrates your Spree Store with Betaout, an e-commerce marketing
platform.

Installation
------------

Add spree_betaout to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_betaout'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_betaout:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_betaout/factories'
```

Configuration
------------

Upon installation, go to your Spree Configuration tab, and go to the Betaout
settings page. Enter your Project ID, API Key, and API Secret which can be
retrived from your Betaout dashboard.

Usage
----

On every request to a page in your Spree store, we check to see if the user has
an OTT (One Time Token) from Betaout stored in their session. If not, we
retrieve one and store it in their session.

#TODO: describe how to add this functionality to pages not controlled by Spree
